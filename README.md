### Objectives 

This project focuses on analyzing the following business problem

and target specific regions for promotional campaigns to boost sales in high-revenue areas and address underperforming regions for improvements.
- Demographic by age group: Segment customers into eg(less than 25yrs as "Youth", 24-35yrs "Young Adult", more than 35yrs "Adult" to know which age group patronize the most and tailor marketing strategies to target specific age groups and genders, optimizing product appeal for the key demographic segments.
- Product Popularity: Assess the performance of different models of bike racks (e.g., "Hitch Rack - 4-Bike") in terms of sales volume. Inorder to refine product offerings, adjust inventory, and promote best-selling items to maximize profit.
- Sales Seasonality: Analyze trends in bike rack sales across different times of the year and correlate them with external factors like holidays or cycling season, thereby planning inventory and marketing efforts according to seasonal peaks and troughs, ensuring sufficient stock during high-demand periods and reducing excess inventory during low-demand months.

### Key Performance indicator (KPIs)

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from excel and can be accessed using this link. [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

### Tool used 
Microsoft Excel 
 1. For data cleaning
 2. For Analysis
 3. For visualization

### Steps followed 
 1. Data cleaning: The raw data collected was first processed to ensure its integrity, consistency, and quality, setting a strong foundation for effective analysis and visualization.
- Data filtering and missing values: I began by addressing missing entries. For numerical fields such as quantity or age, I checked for outliers. If outliers were detected, I filled the blanks using the median or mode; if no outliers were present, I filled them with the average value.
- For categorical variables like gender, country, or state, I utilized a nested IF function to logically fill in the blanks based on existing data.
- Correcting Misspellings: I conducted a review of the dataset to identify any misspelled words or inconsistencies in text fields, replacing incorrect terms with the appropriate ones to maintain uniformity.
- Standardizing Formats: I ensured that all relevant fields, such as Revenue, unit_price and dates, were formatted consistently to facilitate smooth analysis.
- Sorting the Data: I organized the data according to relevant criteria, whether alphabetically (A to Z or Z to A) or chronologically (from oldest to newest or vice versa), to enhance readability and trend identifications.
- Removing Duplicates: I removed duplicate records to maintain data accuracy and integrity.
-Structuring for Analysis: Finally, I converted the cleaned data into a structured table format, making it ready for analysis using pivot tables.
2. Data analysis: In this phase, I leveraged pivot tables in Excel to summarize and analyze the data in alignment with key performance indicators (KPIs) and specific business requirements, always keeping the broader business objectives in mind. I used filters where needed to ensure the analysis was tailored and focused.
- I created a variety of charts, including bar charts, column charts, pie charts and line charts which helped bring the data to life, making it easier to spot trends, compare metrics, and uncover insights that support strategic decision-making. I also added slicers, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data, making it easier to interact with the information and drill down into specific segments as needed.
3. Data visualization: In this phase, I crafted an interactive dashboard that brought together all the essential charts, slicers, KPIs, and the business name, arranging each element thoughtfully to ensure clarity and impact. This dashboard provided a one-stop view of the data, making it easy to spot key trends and business challenges at a glance.
- With a clear view of the business’s pain points, I was able to provide actionable recommendations aimed at addressing these areas and drive growth. The dashboard wasn’t just a set of visuals; but a tool designed to empower decision-making, transforming data into insights and strategies that can elevate the business to the next level.

## Data Visualization and Insights
